## Containerized Applications Integration

### Container Placeholder Structure
Use the sections below to document containerized services integrated with the UI:

#### Service 1: Backend API Container
```
Name: [Container Name]
Image: [Docker Image]
Port: [Port Mapping]
Purpose: [Service Purpose]
Integration Points: [UI Components that consume this service]
```

#### Service 2: Database Container
```
Name: [Container Name]
Image: [Docker Image]
Port: [Port Mapping]
Purpose: [Service Purpose]
Integration Points: [UI Components that consume this service]
```

#### Service 3: Cache/Session Container
```
Name: [Container Name]
Image: [Docker Image]
Port: [Port Mapping]
Purpose: [Service Purpose]
Integration Points: [UI Components that consume this service]
```

#### Service 4: Additional Services
```
Name: [Container Name]
Image: [Docker Image]
Port: [Port Mapping]
Purpose: [Service Purpose]
Integration Points: [UI Components that consume this service]
```

## Development Process

### Streamlined Workflow
1. **Plan** - Define component requirements and mockups
2. **Implement** - Code UI components following established patterns
3. **Test** - Unit test components and container integration
4. **Deploy** - Build Docker images and orchestrate containers
5. **Monitor** - Track performance metrics and user feedback
